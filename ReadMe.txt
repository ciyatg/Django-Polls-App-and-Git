I started to learn Django and how to use Git Bash. With Django I will create a blog. I will save and share my notes on my GitHub account.

I will firstly follow the tutorials on my first main learning source https://www.djangoproject.com/. 
Below one can see the main topics of the tutorials with the name of the branches I created for them.
 
1. lesson1-polls: I created the first Django-powered page and started the polls app.
2. lesson2-database: Through this tutorial I created a database for the polls app and I worked on the automatically-generated admin site. 
3. lesson3-view: Starting from views I worked on URLpatterns and templates.
4. lesson4-template: Changed some codes with their generic version. Generic
views help us to write shorter codes.
